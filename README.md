# TableDisco
**TableDisco** is a connected and music reactive table light. Each table light is working without any *outside* dependencies. 

The first powered **TableDisco** will start a naive *WiFi-Mesh* and is the *root* of the new **TableDisco** mesh. The *root disco* act as the *sound analyzer* for the whole mesh. Each addtional powered **TableDisco** will automatically connect to the mesh.

On activation the **TableDiscos** are *"only"* pretty table lights. As soon as
the *mode switcher* is pressed on the *root disco*, all **TableDiscos** will switch to the **Disco Mode**.

In **Disco Mode** the *root disco* will analyze the surrounding sound. By taking the volume and frequency into account, it will calculate a color and brightness. The *root disco* will then broadcast this color to the **TableDisco** mesh. Doing so, all **TableDiscos** will simultaneously react to the surrounding sound of the *root disco*.

Furthermore the **TableDisco** includes an OTA update mechanism.

## 3D Model
The model was designed in Fusion360. The STLs are included in the Thingiverse downloads and the Github repository. Furthermore there is an exported Fusion360 Archive File ready to download.
